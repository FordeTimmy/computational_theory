## Introduction

This notebook demonstrates and explores key ideas in computational theory, including:

- Bitwise operations and binary manipulation
- Hashing functions and SHA-256 padding
- Turing Machine logic and simulation
- Prime number generation and root extraction
- Proof-of-work concept using SHA-256
- Algorithm complexity through bubble sort analysis

Each task includes:
- Python implementation
- Plain English explanation
- Outputs for validation

## Repository Structure

├── tasks.ipynb          # Main notebook containing all task solutions
├── README.md            # Overview and guide to the repository
├── .gitignore           # Specifies files to ignore in version control


## List of Tasks Completed

 As shown in `tasks.md`, all taks have been completed and documented in `tasks.ipynb`. Each task is clearly labeled using Markdown headers, with accompanying code, explanations, and inline comments.

## Features

- Clear narrative in the notebook using markdown cells to guide the reader through the thought process and solution.
- Python code follows PEP8 standards with clean formatting and meaningful variable names.
- Where relevant, references, research, and reasoning are included to support decisions.
- Frequent and incremental commits showcase steady progress, including revisions and refinements.


## Libraries Used

The following standard and approved external Python libraries were used in this project:

- `math`
- `hashlib`
- `itertools`
- `os`
- `time`
- `requests`
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)

All libraries used are either part of the Python Standard Library or approved for use in the assessment brief.


 ### Timeline and History of Commits

 As shown in the Git commit log, work started early in the semester and moved forward every week.  Meaningful commit messages keep track of all the big steps and changes.


## How to View the Project

The notebook can be viewed directly on GitHub, or you can clone the repository and run it locally:

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash

 ### Criteria for Evaluation Covered

 This submission addresses the five core marking categories:

| Category     | Evidence                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Presentation | Well-structured repo, clear markdown, clean file organization            |
| Research     | References and additional explanations included in markdown              |
| Documentation| Detailed markdown cells and code comments                                |
| Development  | Efficient and correct code, broken into logical steps                    |
| Consistency  | Regular commits show progress and iterative improvements
