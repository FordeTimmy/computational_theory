    "#### Binary Representation \n",
    "Binary representation  is a way of representing numbers, text, or data using two digits 0 and 1. This system is used by computers because they operate using binary logic. [Binary Representations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-representations-in-digital-logic/ \"GeeksforGeeks: Binary Representations\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Binary:\n",
    " - Each digit is called a bit.\n",
    " - A group of 8 bits froms a byte.\n",
    " - Binary numbers represent values in base-2, as opposed to base-10 in decimal."

    "A bit shift is an operation that moves bits to the left or right within a binary number. [Bit Shifts](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shift-micro-operations-in-computer-architecture/ \"GeeksforGeeks: Shift Micro-Operations\")\n",

    "There are two main types of bit shifts:\n",
    "1. Left Shift (<<): Moves the bit to the left and fills the rightmost bit with 0:\n",

    "- Example:\n",
    "0010 1101 shifted left by 1 position becomes 0101 1010\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Right Shift (>>): Moves the bit to the right and fills the leftmost bit depending on the shift type:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Arithmetic right shift: Fills leftmost bit with the sign bit(used for signed numbers).\n",

    "- Example of arithmetic shift: 1011 1000 shifted right by 1 position with a sign extension becomes 1101 1100.\n",
